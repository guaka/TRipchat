add TODO items here.. pull requests welcome

vibes:
- improve nip-05 validation of notes
- improve user flow for first time users
- also show hitchwiki/map stuff, as part of map stuff, coming from nostrhitch (see also recent.hitchwiki.org)
- Stats is now green on green, make it more readable, also make the entire thing clickable to expand
- when I remove a relay it's back after I refresh, this should not be the case


humans:
- try to let actual people use this at https://guaka.github.io/TRipchat/
- figure out trustroots mailing list stuff, make it prettier and less likely to end up in spam
